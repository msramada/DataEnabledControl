## Background: data-driven control
This package is based on the paper [Data-Enabled Predictive Control: In the Shallows of the DeePC](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8795639), which is a behavioral data-driven approach. For more context, the interested reader may consult [A note on persistency of excitation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167691104001434).

Note: our package, for now, considers only the regulation problem, that is, tracking the trajectory `y=r=0`.
